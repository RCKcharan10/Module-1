# Experiment No: 1B – Data Types – Identifying Literal Types

## AIM  
To write a Python program to read the input from the user and print the type of the literal using `eval()`.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Read input from the user using `input()`.  
3. Use `eval()` to evaluate the input to its actual data type.  
4. Use `type()` function to identify the type of the evaluated input.  
5. Print the identified type.  
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python

data = input()
data1 = eval(data)
print(type(data1))

```

## RESULT
Thus the Python program Identifying Literal Types have been executed and verified successfully.
